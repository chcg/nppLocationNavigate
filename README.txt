!!! THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT WORK !!!

I"m trying to fix the orginal broken plugin, but having little luck.

NAME

Notepad++ Location Navigation


DESCRIPTION

The original plugin was posted here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/locationnav/

I modified some shortcuts and added a menu checkmark to the 
"Show List and Options" menu item so it can be shown and removed 
from the plugin menu.

I also cleaned up the code after importing the project to 
MS Visual Studio Community 2017.


DEPENDENCIES

I used MS Visual Studio Community 2017.

[x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017]
Configuration=Release
Platform=Win32

  msbuild


INSTALLATION

Take the DLL LocationNavigate.dll in the ./bin folder of this repository 
and copy to the Notepad++ plugins folder.
